Project Description (1-2 pages):

Description: 
We planned on making a simulation of plant life and growth in terms of a battle for resources to grow. The basis of the simulation would be a grid of generated soil, with randomly allocated “nutrients” varying in quality in the soil. Start plants are randomly allocated a position in the soil and will begin to “grow”. 

The plant needs a certain amount of resources to stay alive depending on their current size and they’ll also need a certain amount of resources to continue to grow. They would grow towards the nearest nutrients in varying ways, some plants would consume resources at a faster rate but grow faster while others could grow slower but consume less resources. The larger a plant grows the more resources it can attempt to gain access to but also the more resources it consumes. If a plant grows too big and it doesn’t have the sufficient resources to support itself or does not gain access to enough resources at the beginning the plant dies. If the plant finds a resources nearby to survive and grow it will stop growth till the next revolution. The more the plant grows the higher likelihood the plan finds more resources and survives. Each plant has different rates of growth, dictated by the size of the plant and its basic type.

If a plant survives a certain amount of growth revolutions the types of plant remaining would be taken and  depending on its size and the amount of that type they would then breed a new generation. The better a type performs the higher likelihood it continues onto the next generation.

Division of Work: We’ll be approaching this project in a pair programming fashion but we’ll accept individual responsibilities for back end and front end modules of this project.

Programming language(s) - Java

Programming tool(s) - Java Compiler, Text editor, Java Libraries

Learning Challenges - We will face many challenges with this project, the first of which would be to learn how to plan, code and debug self learning a.i. to simulate the plant growth. We would also have to look into game theory with the plants competing against each other for resources. We would also have to research, look up and develop algorithms that simulate plant growth. We will learn how to use java libraries such as Weka and JSL for our project.

Hardware / software platform - OpenSuse Linux, Lab PC

Special Hardware/Software Requirements: None
